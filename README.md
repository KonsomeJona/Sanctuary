## Description

Sanctuary relies on the Android Work Profile APIs to create a self-contained work profile on a user's personal device. Managed apps, data, and management policies are restricted to the work profile, keeping them secure and separate from personal data while maintaining user privacy.

See Sanctuary as having a second device, a sandbox where other or same applications are also running but using different accounts, settings and data, thus allowing you to:

• Improve privacy protection

• Run a second instance of an application with a different account or configuration

• Hide and block access to applications from people around you

• Temporarily disable applications and block their background behaviors

• Run applications on a separate network (VPN, …)

• Access to more advanced secure settings and restrictions

We also guarantee that no data is being collected. For more information, read our privacy policy.
